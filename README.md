**NAME**

Hash::Iterator - Hashtable Iterator.

**SYNOPSIS**

```perl
    my $iterator = Hash::Iterator->new( map { $_ => uc $_ } 'a'..'z' );

    while ($iterator->next) {
        say sprintf("%s => %s", $iterator->peek_key, $iterator->peek_value);
    }

    my $iterator = Hash::Iterator->new( a => [qw(one two three)] );
    $iterator->next;

    if ( $iterator->is_ref('ARRAY') ) {
        foreach my $item ( @{$iterator->peek_value} ) {
            say $item;
        }
    }	
```

**DESCRIPTION**

_CONSTRUCTORS_

_new_

```perl
	my $iterator = Hash::Iterator->new( %hash );
```

Return a Hash::Iterator for C<hash>

**METHODS**

_next_
```perl
    $iterator->next;
```
Advance the iterator to the next key-value pair

_previous_
```perl
    $iterator->previous;
```
Advance the iterator to the previous key-value pair

_done_
```perl
    do {
        ....
    } while ($iterator->done);
```
Returns a boolean value if the iterator was exhausted

_peek_key_
```perl
    say $iterator->peek_key;
```
Return the key of the current key-value pair. It's not allowed to
call this method before L<next()|/next> was called for the first time or
after the iterator was exhausted.

_peek_value_
```perl
    say $iterator->peek_value;
```
Return the value of the current key-value pair.  It's not allowed to
call this method before L<next()|/next> was called for the first time or
after the iterator was exhausted.

_is_ref_
```perl
    if ( $iterator->is_ref('ARRAY') ) {
        ...
    }
```
Returns a boolean value if value is a reference.

_get_keys_
```perl
    my @keys =  $iterator->get_keys;
```
Returns a list of all keys from hash
